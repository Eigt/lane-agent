This is a non-interactive simulation I made from scratch as an assignment.
It features an AI-based agent in red trying to visit every side room before exiting to the right.
Blue agents travel along the lanes in a procedurally-generated fashion and get in the red agent's way.

*Requires Unity to be installed.
